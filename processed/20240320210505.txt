Q.1. Answer the following:                  [10 Marks]  
A. Consider a CNN architecture with an input image of size 128×128×3. The architecture 
consists of three convolutional layers with 32 and 64 filters of size 3 × 3 respectively, 
followed by a max -pooling layer of size 2 × 2. Calculate the output dimensions after each 
layer.  [4M]  
B. If the input image size is changed to 64×64, how will it affect the number of trainable 
parameters?  [1M]  
C. Compute the trainable parameters are there in the first convolutional layer. [1M]  
D. Write Python code to implement this architecture using TensorFlow Keras.  [2M]  
E. Given a 3x3 input matrix I and a 2x2 filter F,  
 
Compute the output matrix after applying the convolution operation. If your BITS ID is 
odd use a stride of 1 otherwise use a st ride of 2. Assume zero -padding.  [2M]

Q.2. Answer the following:                 [10 Marks]  
A. A data scientist wants to build a Deep Learning model using a single LSTM cell for 
forecasting a time series. The training dataset has several records with 15 time  steps  each. 
Each time step consists of three -feature normalized numeric data. If the total learnable 
parameters in this model are 180, what is the dimensionality of the short state?                                                                 
[3M]  
B. A security  company wants to use AI to analyze surveillance footage and automatically 
detect unusual activities. The system needs to be able to analyze hours of footage and 
identify moments of interest. Describe the neural network architecture you would 
recommend for  this task. Justify your choice. Explain how you would handle the temporal 
dependencies in the video data. [3M]  
C. A company wants to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews. Each review is a 
sequence of words, and the reviews vary in length. Describe the neural network architecture 
you would recommend for this task. Justify your choice.  [2M]  
D. An automotive company is developing an autonomous vehicle. One of the challenges is to 
recognize traffic signs and signals accurately in different lightin g conditions. Describe the 
neural network architecture you would recommend for this task, and justify your choice.  
Discuss how you would ensure the model generalizes well to different lighting conditions.

Q.3. Consider the following:                [10 Marks]  
 
SEQ1: {100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900}  
SEQ2: {90,190,290,390,490,590,690,790,89}  
OUTPUT = (SEQ1[i] + SEQ2[i])  
Consider implementing an LSTM model for prediction and perform predictions using the 
trained model. The code should demonstrate,  
1. A function to split a multivariate sequence into samples.  [2M]  
2. LSTM model definition and training (50 units, ReLU activation, dense layer with a single 
output unit, 20 epochs)  [3M] 
3. A stacked LSTM to handle multiple parallel serie s. [3M]  
4. Evaluate the model performance using metrics  (any two)  of your choice.  [2M]

Q.4. A RNN is shown below with one RNN layer of two tanh neurons and a fully connected output 
layer with one sigmoid n euron. A record of input with one time -step and two input features is 
processed with it. Calculate the output of the network assuming all weights and biases are 
initialized with value 0.12 and the previous state as [0.1, 0.2]. The arrows shown in the diagr am 
are representative.                                                                            [5 Marks]
